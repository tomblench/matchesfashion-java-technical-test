# MatchesFashion Java Technical Test

Solution outline:
- Input is streamed in so that large texts can be processed without incurring a large memory overhead
- Build a hash table mapping of (`word` → `number of occurrences`)
- Build an inverted hash table mapping of (`number of occurrences` → `list of words`)
- Note that in above step `list of words` is sorted alphabetically for consistent tie-breaking
- Sort inverted hash table by number of occurrences descending
- Flatten out lists of words (in the stream `[[a, b], [c, d]]` becomes `[a, b, c, d]`)
- Return the top 3 words (general case: top _n_ words).

The solution is provided as an IntelliJ IDEA project _and_ a Gradle project. Either can be used for building and running.

IntelliJ tasks are provided:
- "Run main class with Don Quixote first sentence". As described, using one of the provided sample input files.
- "org.blench.matchesfashion.test in MatchesFashionTest". Run all JUnit tests.

_Note: When opening the IntelliJ project you may need to set your project SDK. The build.gradle file does not need to be imported._

Examples below are focussed on running with gradlew at the command line.

# Tests

Run JUnit tests with `./gradlew test`. Test report is in the usual place (`build/reports/tests/test/`).

# Running

## Running with file as input

`./gradlew run -PinputFile=$file`

```
Thomass-MacBook-Pro:MatchesFashionTest tomblench$ ./gradlew run -PinputFile=./donquixote-first3paras.txt

## Running with stdin input

Type input at terminal and end with Ctrl-D or pipe input in from elsewhere.

`./gradlew --console plain run`

```
Thomass-MacBook-Pro:MatchesFashionTest tomblench$ ./gradlew --console plain run

## Running with piped input

Here is a timed example using the full text of "Don Quixote" as input.

```

## Running with pre-canned input

`./gradlew runWithDonQuixote`

## Running with debug output switched on

`./gradlew run -PinputFile=./donquixote-firstsentence.txt -DdumpTable=true`

```
Thomass-MacBook-Pro:MatchesFashionTest tomblench$ ./gradlew run -PinputFile=./donquixote-firstsentence.txt -DdumpTable=true
